Got it, let me update the README to reflect that admins approve user account creation, not recipes:

# Recipe Sharing App

This is a recipe sharing app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Users can sign up and submit recipes. Admins must approve user accounts before they are able to login and use the app.

## Features

- User registration and account approval flow
- Recipe submission  
- Search recipes
- View recipe details
- Save recipes to favorites
- Admin panel to manage user accounts

## Usage 

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run Server 

```
npm run build 
npm start
```

The server will run on http://localhost:3000
